Looking to play as a prostitute? OProstitution brings many new hours of gameplay and plenty of roleplay opportunity. Based loosely on the famous Your Market Stall mod, you'll be setting up your own sex business and completing detailed jobs. 



The Lantern

At a forge, you can craft a Prostitution Lantern. This special lantern glows light red, and is used to signal to customers that you are a prostitute. After crafting the lantern, open your inventory and drop it on the ground and it will magically set itself up. You can move it again by pressing E on it 

With a lantern placed down, as long as you are within about 30 meters of it, clients will know you're a prostitute and begin approaching you with sex offers.



Prostitute sex 

Most clients will have specific sexual requests that you must fulfill during the act to receive payment. You can view all active requests by holding the ORomance key during sex. There is a large variety of requests clients may have. Some clients have special requests they can make too. Clients may refuse to pay if you do not complete all of their requests.

Attracting clients

With the prostitution lantern placed down, clients will approach you. However, at first they will usually not do so very often. During the daytime, most people are not looking for prostitutes so waiting for clients in the middle of the day is far less effective. Additionally, as your reputation increases, clients will begin to approach you more frequently. Sometimes, you might just be in an area where nobody wants a prostitute. If nobody approaches you after a full night of waiting, try setting up in another area.

Not everyone in Skyrim will have sex with prostitutes. Most married NPCs will never approach you, and additionally depending on their ORomance stats they may never approach you. Factors such as their sexuality, their arousal, and their ORomance stats determine if they will.

Reputation and leveling

You begin at prostitution level 1 and can reach a max of level 5

You earn reputation through working, which increases your level. The main thing a higher level gives you is more customers, as a higher level means clients will approach you more frequently

Working for a store owner, licensing, and prostitution in public

Prostitution is illegal in Skyrim without a license. You can purchase a license at the lantern for 2500 septims, however, early on you may want to work inside an inn, or maybe even a store, where you won't be caught not having a license. You can set up shop inside any store, inn, or business in Skyrim and the store owner will automatically take a cut of your profits. The amount they take is dependent on their ORomance personality. A small few may take the entirety of your profits.
Note that on the OProstitution screen, the payout shown already has the owner's cut deducted.

Misc features
Having your lantern in the same area for a long period of time will "warm up" that area, and your approach rate will increase, since people know where to find you easily.

Recommended mods
Since this mod has heavy roleplay potential and involves hanging around one area, I recommend a few mods that may improve the experience:
- SkyrimSouls, so time passes while in your inventory
- Mods that let you place down furniture like Campfire addons
- YourMarketStall if you want to run a  shop alongside your current business
- Mods that add more npcs
- Mods that make NPC AI more complex and travel around more often

FAQ

> Will women approach me if I'm playing as a woman? Can I use this as a male char?

That is determined by ORomance's sexuality option. However, women have a lower chance across the board of approaching even if you play as a male. So this particular addon is usually better played with a female char, but both can work!

>I'm having trouble using the prostitution confirmation menu

The menu's controls are read from ORomance's menus. If you have a controller or something you will want to do some remapping and testing with ORomance. Once ORomance is working for you, OProstitution's menus will also start working.

>Nobody is showing up to me

Your first customer may take a full night of waiting to appear, if you're waiting longer than that then more than likely nobody around you is interested in prostitution and you should move to a new place with new people

>If I place my lantern during the daytime do I have to pick it up and replace it when it gets dark to get better traffic? Also does it help to move the lantern around the room i'm in

No, you don't need to move the lantern unless you are moving to a new place completely, and the radius is big enough that you can set it anywhere in a place like an inn and move around freely without being next to it.

>I get a "someone else is using this" message with the lantern

Harmless side-effect, please ignore until I get a proper way to hide it in!

>My client finished before they were satisfied with the sex act?

Slow down and take breaks from time to time

>Can I place multiple lanterns?

Yes, but only 1 per area.
